# POS-System
A C++ POS system that allows staff to process transaction, print receipt and keep track of their sales. It's based off on Green Eight Pharmacy's POS system used back then. 

It's created back in 2018 - the first major programming project that I've implemented for a course. It's riddled with bugs and needs a major overhaul, but it allows its users to manage supplies, accept transactions and returns, print receipts and keep track of the business' income summary.
